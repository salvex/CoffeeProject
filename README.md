# CoffeeProject

-------

## Notes

This is an "university project" for the course "System Web Design" at MS Computer Engineering @unipa realized using **Jakarta\Java EE** as back-end and **JavaScript\jQuery & JSP** as front-end, running on **Apache Tomcat (9.0.55)** middleware. Feel free to use it as "example" or "inspiration" (you should not take the entire project and use it as it was yours, it's not "ethical" ðŸ˜…)
